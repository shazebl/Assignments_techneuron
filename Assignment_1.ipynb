    "\n",
    "1) In the below elements which of them are values or an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "*       - Expression\n",
    "'hello' - Value (string)\n",
    "-87.8   - Value (floating point number)\n",
    "-       - Expression\n",
    "/       - Expression\n",
    "+       - Expression\n",
    "6       - Value (integer)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "String is a immutable data type which is used to represent the characters. \n",
    "Variable or object is used to store the values of various data types (string, int, float, etc.) into the RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Describe three different data types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer\n",
    "List\n",
    "String\n",
    " \n",
    "4) What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is made up of mathematical, logical, conditional, boolean operators, etc.\n",
    "Boolean expressions gives True/False values.\n",
    "Mathematical operators perform addition, subtraction, etc.\n",
    "Contional expressions check the conditions and excute the code.\n",
    "Logical expressions use AND OR truth tables and give results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement refers to defining a operation such as assigning a particular value to a variable or defining a variable or perfoming conditional operations.\n",
    "Expression refers to the type of operation performed. Ex: spam = 10 (= is an expression which assigns the value 10 to the variable spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "6) After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of bacon variable = 22 since the value of the addition operation is not stored in bacon.\n",

    "7) What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3          = 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "In python that the variable name should not start with a number.\n",
    "100 is not considered as a varibale name because it is a value.\n",
    "Eggs is a valid variable name because it is not a keyword and does not start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string\n",
    "version of a value?\n",

    "10) Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos'\n",
    "\n",
    "99 is of integer data type and cannot be concatenated with string data type.\n",
    "You can fix it by converting 99 of integer data type to string data type by:\n",
    "Enclosing 99 into single/double quotes -  'I have eaten' + '99' + 'burritos'\n",
    "Converting 99 to string data type      - 'I have eaten' + str(99) + 'burritos'\n",
